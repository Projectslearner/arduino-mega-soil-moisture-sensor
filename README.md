# Soil Moisture Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
The Soil Moisture Sensor project demonstrates how to use an analog soil moisture sensor with an Arduino Mega to monitor moisture levels in soil. This project is essential for applications such as automated irrigation systems, plant health monitoring, and soil moisture studies.

#### Components Needed
- **Arduino Mega**
- **Analog Soil Moisture Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Soil Moisture Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Signal Pin:** Connected to analog pin A0 on the Arduino Mega.
   - **Power (+) and Ground (-):** Connected to 5V and GND on the Arduino Mega respectively.

#### Instructions
1. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

2. **Testing:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Observe the moisture level percentage readings.
   - Dip the sensor in water to see the percentage increase, and let it dry to see it decrease.

#### Applications
- **Automated Irrigation Systems:** Trigger watering based on soil moisture levels.
- **Plant Health Monitoring:** Ensure optimal soil conditions for plant growth.
- **Research and Education:** Conduct experiments on soil moisture dynamics.

#### Notes
- **Mapping Function:** The `map()` function converts the analog sensor value to a percentage range (0-100%).
- **Delay:** A delay is included to prevent rapid serial output and to stabilize sensor readings.
